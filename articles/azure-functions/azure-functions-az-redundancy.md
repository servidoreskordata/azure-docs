# Azure Functions support for availability zone redundancy

Azure function apps in the Premium plan can be deployed into availability zones to help you achieve resiliency and reliability for your business-critical workloads. This architecture is also known as zone redundancy.

Availability zones support for Azure Functions is available on Premium (Elastic Premium) and Dedicated (App Service) plans. A zone-redundant function app plan automatically balances its instances between availability zones for higher availability. This article focuses on zone redundancy support for Premium plans. For zone redundancy on Dedicated plans, refer [here](../availability-zones/migrate-app-service.md).

## Overview

An [availability zone](../availability-zones/az-overview.md#availability-zones) is a high-availability offering that protects your applications and data from datacenter failures. Availability zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region. Each zone comprises one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. To ensure resiliency, there's a minimum of three separate zones in all enabled regions. You can build high-availability into your application architecture by co-locating your compute, storage, networking, and data resources within a zone and replicating into other zones.

A zone redundant function app automatically distributes the instances your app runs on between the availability zones in the region. For apps running in a zone-redundant Premium plan, even as the app scales in and out, the instances the app is running on are still evenly distributed between availability zones.

Function apps are zonal services, which means that function apps can be deployed using one of the following methods:

- For function apps that aren't configured to be zone redundant, the instances are placed in a single zone that is selected by the platform in the selected region.
- For function apps that are configured as zone redundant, the platform automatically spreads the instances in the plan across all the zones in the selected region. For example, in a region with three zones, if an instance count is larger than three and the number of instances is divisible by three, the instances is distributed evenly. Otherwise, instance counts beyond `3 * N` are distributed across the remaining one or two zones.

## Availability zone considerations

All of the available function app instances of function apps configured as zone redundant are enabled and processing events. When a zone goes down, Functions detect lost instances and automatically attempts to find new replacement instances, when needed. [Elastic scale behavior](functions-premium-plan.md#rapid-elastic-scale) still applies. However, in a zone-down scenario there's no guarantee that requests for additional instances can succeed, since back-filling lost instances occurs on a best-effort basis.

Applications that are deployed in a Premium plan that has availability zones enabled continue to run even when other zones in the same region suffer an outage. However, it's possible that non-runtime behaviors could still be impacted from an outage in other availability zones. These impacted behaviors can include Premium plan scaling, application creation, application configuration, and application publishing. Zone redundancy for Premium plans only guarantees continued uptime for deployed applications.

When Functions allocates instances to a zone redundant Premium plan, it uses [best effort zone balancing offered by the underlying Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-use-availability-zones.md#zone-balancing). A Premium plan is considered _balanced_ when each zone has either the same number of VMs (Â± 1 VM) in all of the other zones used by the Premium plan.

## Requirements

Availability zone support is a property of the Premium plan. The following are the current requirements/limitations for enabling availability zones:

- You can only enable availability zones when creating a Premium plan for your function app. You can't convert an existing Premium plan to use availability zones.
- You must use a [zone redundant storage account (ZRS)](../storage/common/storage-redundancy.md#zone-redundant-storage) for your function app's [storage account](storage-considerations.md#storage-account-requirements). If you use a different type of storage account, Functions may show unexpected behavior during a zonal outage.
- Both Windows and Linux are supported.
- Must be hosted on an [Elastic Premium](functions-premium-plan.md) or Dedicated hosting plan. To learn how to use zone redundancy with a Dedicated plan, see [Migrate App Service to availability zone support](../availability-zones/migrate-app-service.md).
  - Availability zone support isn't currently available for function apps on [Consumption](consumption-plan.md) plans.
- Function apps hosted on a Premium plan must have a minimum [always ready instances](functions-premium-plan.md#always-ready-instances) count of three.
  - The platform will enforce this minimum count behind the scenes if you specify an instance count fewer than three.
- If you aren't using Premium plan or a scale unit that supports availability zones, are in an unsupported region, or are unsure, see the [migration guidance](../availability-zones/migrate-functions.md).

## How to deploy a function app on a zone redundant Premium plan

There are currently two ways to deploy a zone-redundant Premium plan and function app. You can use either the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) or an ARM template.

# [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Open the Azure portal and navigate to the **Create Function App** page. Information on creating a function app in the portal can be found [here](functions-create-function-app-portal.md#create-a-function-app).

1. In the **Basics** page, fill out the fields for your function app. Pay special attention to the fields in the table below (also highlighted in the screenshot below), which have specific requirements for zone redundancy.

    | Setting      | Suggested value  | Notes for Zone Redundancy |
    | ------------ | ---------------- | ----------- |
    | **Region** | Preferred region | The subscription under which this new function app is created. You must pick a region that is availability zone enabled from the [list above](#requirements). |

    ![Screenshot of Basics tab of function app create page.](./media/functions-az-redundancy\azure-functions-basics-az.png)

1. In the **Hosting** page, fill out the fields for your function app hosting plan. Pay special attention to the fields in the table below (also highlighted in the screenshot below), which have specific requirements for zone redundancy.

    | Setting      | Suggested value  | Notes for Zone Redundancy |
    | ------------ | ---------------- | ----------- |
    | **Storage Account** | A [zone-redundant storage account](storage-considerations.md#storage-account-requirements) | As mentioned above in the [requirements](#requirements) section, we strongly recommend using a zone-redundant storage account for your zone redundant function app. |
    | **Plan Type** | Functions Premium | This article details how to create a zone redundant app in a Premium plan. Zone redundancy isn't currently available in Consumption plans. Information on zone redundancy on app service plans can be found [in this article](../availability-zones/migrate-app-service.md). |
    | **Zone Redundancy** | Enabled | This field populates the flag that determines if your app is zone redundant or not. You won't be able to select `Enabled` unless you have chosen a region supporting zone redundancy, as mentioned in step 2. |

    ![Screenshot of Hosting tab of function app create page.](./media/functions-az-redundancy\azure-functions-hosting-az.png)

1. For the rest of the function app creation process, create your function app as normal. There are no fields in the rest of the creation process that affect zone redundancy.

# [ARM template](#tab/arm-template)

You can use an [ARM template](../azure-resource-manager/templates/quickstart-create-templates-use-visual-studio-code.md) to deploy to a zone-redundant Premium plan. A guide to hosting Functions on Premium plans can be found [here](functions-infrastructure-as-code.md#deploy-on-premium-plan).

The only properties to be aware of while creating a zone-redundant hosting plan are the new `zoneRedundant` property and the plan's instance count (`capacity`) fields. The `zoneRedundant` property must be set to `true` and the `capacity` property should be set based on the workload requirement, but not less than `3`. Choosing the right capacity varies based on several factors and high availability/fault tolerance strategies. A good rule of thumb is to ensure sufficient instances for the application such that losing one zone of instances leaves sufficient capacity to handle expected load.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Functions apps hosted on an elastic premium, zone-redundant plan must have a minimum [always ready instance](functions-premium-plan.md#always-ready-instances) count of 3. This make sure that a zone-redundant function app always has enough instances to satisfy at least one worker per zone.

Below is an ARM template snippet for a zone-redundant, Premium plan showing the `zoneRedundant` field and the `capacity` specification.

```json
"resources": [
    {
        "type": "Microsoft.Web/serverfarms",
        "apiVersion": "2021-01-15",
        "name": "<YOUR_PLAN_NAME>",
        "location": "<YOUR_REGION_NAME>",
        "sku": {
            "name": "EP1",
            "tier": "ElasticPremium",
            "size": "EP1",
            "family": "EP", 
            "capacity": 3
        },
        "kind": "elastic",
        "properties": {
            "perSiteScaling": false,
            "elasticScaleEnabled": true,
            "maximumElasticWorkerCount": 20,
            "isSpot": false,
            "reserved": false,
            "isXenon": false,
            "hyperV": false,
            "targetWorkerCount": 0,
            "targetWorkerSizeId": 0, 
            "zoneRedundant": true
        }
    }
]
```

After the zone-redundant plan is created and deployed, any function app hosted on your new plan is considered zone-redundant.

## Migrate your function app to a zone-redundant plan

For information on how to migrate the public multi-tenant Premium plan from non-availability zone to availability zone support, see [Migrate App Service to availability zone support](../availability-zones/migrate-functions.md).

## Pricing

There's no additional cost associated with enabling availability zones. Pricing for a zone redundant Premium plan is the same as a single zone Premium plan. You'll be charged based on your Premium plan SKU, the capacity you specify, and any instances you scale to based on your autoscale criteria. If you enable availability zones but specify a capacity less than three, the platform will enforce a minimum instance count of three and charge you for those three instances.
