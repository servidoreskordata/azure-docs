<!-- Intent: As a dev infrastructure manager, I want to be able to manage dev centers so that I can manage my Microsoft Dev Box implementation. -->

# Manage a dev center
Development teams vary in the way they function and may have different needs. A dev center helps you to manage these different scenarios by enabling you to group similar sets of projects together and apply similar settings.
## Permissions
To manage a dev center, you need the following permissions:

|Action|Permission required|
|-----|-----|
|Create or delete dev center|Owner or Contributor permissions on an Azure Subscription or a specific resource group.|
|Manage a dev center|Owner or Contributor roles, or specific Write permission to the dev center.|
|Attach or remove network connection|Network Contributor permissions on an existing network connection (owner or contributor).|

## Create a dev center
Your development teamsâ€™ requirements change over time. You can create a new dev center to support organizational changes like a new business requirement or a new regional center. You can create as many or as few dev centers as you need, depending on how you organize and manage your development teams.

The following steps show you how to create a dev center.
