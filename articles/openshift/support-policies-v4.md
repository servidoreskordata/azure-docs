# Azure Red Hat OpenShift 4.0 support policy

Certain configurations for Azure Red Hat OpenShift 4 clusters can affect your cluster's supportability. Azure Red Hat OpenShift 4 allows cluster administrators to make changes to internal cluster components, but not all changes are supported. The support policy below shares what modifications violate the policy and void support from Microsoft and Red Hat.

> [!NOTE]
> Features marked Technology Preview in OpenShift Container Platform are not supported in Azure Red Hat OpenShift.

## Cluster configuration requirements

* All OpenShift Cluster operators must remain in a managed state. The list of cluster operators can be returned by running `oc get clusteroperators`.
* The cluster must have a minimum of three worker nodes and three manager nodes.
* Don't scale the cluster workers to zero, or attempt a cluster shutdown. Deallocating or powering down any virtual machine in the cluster resource group is not supported.
* Don't have taints that prevent OpenShift components to be scheduled.
* Don't remove or modify the cluster Prometheus service.
* Don't remove or modify the cluster Alertmanager service or Default receiver. It *is* supported to create additional receivers to notify external systems.
* Don't remove Service Alertmanager rules.
* Security groups can't be modified. Any attempt to modify security groups will be reverted.
* Don't remove or modify Azure Red Hat OpenShift service logging (mdsd pods).
* Don't remove or modify the 'arosvc.azurecr.io' cluster pull secret.
* All cluster virtual machines must have direct outbound internet access, at least to the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) and service logging (Geneva) endpoints.  No form of HTTPS proxying is supported.
* Don't override any of the cluster's MachineConfig objects (for example, the kubelet configuration) in any way.
* Don't set any unsupportedConfigOverrides options. Setting these options prevents minor version upgrades.
* The Azure Red Hat OpenShift service accesses your cluster via Private Link Service.  Don't remove or modify service access.
* To avoid disruption resulting from cluster maintenance, in-cluster workloads should be configured with high availability practices, including but not limited to pod affinity and anti-affinity, pod disruption budgets, and adequate scaling.
* Non-RHCOS compute nodes aren't supported. For example, you can't use a RHEL compute node.
* Don't place policies within your subscription or management group that prevent SREs from performing normal maintenance against the Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster. For example, don't require tags on the Azure Red Hat OpenShift RP-managed cluster resource group.
* Do not run extra workloads on the control plane nodes. While they can be scheduled on the control plane nodes, it will cause extra resource usage and stability issues that can affect the entire cluster.
* Don't circumvent the deny assignment that is configured as part of the service, or perform administrative tasks that are normally prohibited by the deny assignment.

## Supported virtual machine sizes

Azure Red Hat OpenShift 4 supports node instances on the following virtual machine sizes:
