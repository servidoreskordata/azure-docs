To stay up-to-date with the most recent Azure Video Indexer developments, this article provides you with information about:

* [Important notice](#upcoming-critical-changes) about planned changes
* The latest releases
* Known issues
* Bug fixes
* Deprecated functionality

## Upcoming critical changes

> [!Important]
> This section describes a critical upcoming change for the `Upload-Video` API.

### Upload-Video API

In the past, the `Upload-Video` API was tolerant to calls to upload a video from a URL where an empty multipart form body was provided in the C# code, such as:

```csharp
var content = new MultipartFormDataContent();
var uploadRequestResult = await client.PostAsync($"{apiUrl}/{accountInfo.Location}/Accounts/{accountInfo.Id}/Videos?{queryParams}", content);
```

In the coming weeks, our service will fail requests of this type.

In order to upload a video from a URL, change your code to send null in the request body:

```csharp
var uploadRequestResult = await client.PostAsync($"{apiUrl}/{accountInfo.Location}/Accounts/{accountInfo.Id}/Videos?{queryParams}", null);
```

## August 2022  release updates

### Update topic inferencing model 

Azure Video Indexer topic inferencing model was updated and now we extract more than 6.5 million topics (for example, covering topics such as Covid virus). To benefit from recent model updates you need to re-index your video files. 

### Topic inferencing model is now available on Azure Government 

You can now leverage topic inferencing model in your Azure Video Indexer paid account on [Azure Government](../azure-government/documentation-government-welcome.md) in Virginia and Arizona regions. With this release we completed the AI parity between Azure global and Azure Government. 
To benefit from the model updates you need to re-index your video files. 

### Session length is now 30 days in the Azure Video Indexer website

The [Azure Video Indexer website](https://vi.microsoft.com) session length was extended to 30 days. You can preserve your session without having to re-login every 1 hour.

## July 2022

### Featured clothing insight (preview)

When indexing a video using Azure Video Indexer advanced video settings, you can view the featured clothing of an observed person. The featured clothing insight provides information of key items worn by individuals within a video and the specific time in which the clothing appears. Based on this insight, you can enable more targeted ads placement.

For details on how featured clothing images are ranked and how to view this insight, see [observed people featured clothing](observed-people-featured-clothing.md).

## June 2022

### Create Video Indexer blade improvements in Azure portal 

Azure Video Indexer now supports the creation of new resource using system-assigned managed identity or system and user assigned managed identity for the same resource. 

You can also change the primary managed identity using the **Identity** tab in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home). 

### Limited access of celebrity recognition and face identification features

As part of Microsoft's commitment to responsible AI, we are designing and releasing Azure Video Indexer – identification and celebrity recognition features. These features are designed to protect the rights of individuals and society and fostering transparent human-computer interaction. Thus, there is a limited access and use of Azure Video Indexer – identification and celebrity recognition features. 

Identification and celebrity recognition features require registration and are only available to Microsoft managed customers and partners. 
Customers who wish to use this feature are required to apply and submit an [intake form](https://aka.ms/facerecognition). For more information, read [Azure Video Indexer limited access](limited-access-features.md). 

Also, see the following: the [announcement blog post](https://aka.ms/AAh91ff) and [investment and safeguard for facial recognition](https://aka.ms/AAh9oye).
          
## May 2022

### Line breaking in transcripts

Improved line break logic to better split transcript into sentences. New editing capabilities are now available through the Azure Video Indexer portal, such as adding a new line and editing the line’s timestamp. For more information, see [Insert or remove transcript lines](edit-transcript-lines-portal.md).

### Azure Monitor integration
 
Azure Video Indexer now supports Diagnostics settings for Audit events. Logs of Audit events can now be exported through diagnostics settings to Azure Log Analytics, Storage, Event Hubs, or a third-party solution.

The additions enable easier access to analyze the data, monitor resource operation, and create automatically flows to act on an event. For more information, see [Monitor Azure Video Indexer](monitor-video-indexer.md).

### Video Insights improvements

Object Character Reader (OCR) is improved by 60%. Face Detection is improved by 20%. Label accuracy is improved by 30% over a wide variety of videos. These improvements are available immediately in all regions and do not require any changes by the customer.

### Service tag 

Azure Video Indexer is now part of [Network Service Tags](network-security.md). Video Indexer often needs to access other Azure resources (for example, Storage). If you secure your inbound traffic to your resources with a Network Security Group you can now select Video Indexer as part of the built-in Service Tags. This will simplify security management as we populate the Service Tag with our public IPs.

### Celebrity recognition toggle 

You can now enable or disable the celebrity recognition model on the account level (on classic account only). To turn on or off the model, go to the **Model customization** > toggle on/off the model. Once you disable the model, Video Indexer insights will not include the output of celebrity model and will not run the celebrity model pipeline.

### Observed people tracing (preview)

Azure Video Indexer now detects observed people in videos and provides information such as the location of the person in the video frame and the exact timestamp (start, end) when a person appears. The API returns the bounding box coordinates (in pixels) for each person instance detected, including its confidence.

For example, if a video contains a person, the detect operation will list the person appearances together with their coordinates in the video frames. You can use this functionality to determine the person path in a video. It also lets you determine whether there are multiple instances of the same person in a video.

The newly added observed people tracing feature is available when indexing your file by choosing the **Advanced option** -> **Advanced video** or **Advanced video + audio** preset (under Video + audio indexing). Standard  and basic indexing presets will not include this new advanced model.

When you choose to see Insights of your video on the Azure Video Indexer website, the Observed People Tracing will show up on the page with all detected people thumbnails. You can choose a thumbnail of a person and see where the person appears in the video player.

The feature is also available in the JSON file generated by Azure Video Indexer. For more information, see [Trace observed people in a video](observed-people-tracing.md).

### Detected acoustic events with **Audio Effects Detection** (preview)

You can now see the detected acoustic events in the closed captions file. The file can be downloaded from the Azure Video Indexer portal and is available as an artifact in the GetArtifact API.

### Prepare for upcoming changes

* Today, the following APIs return an account object:

    * [Create-Paid-Account](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/api-details#api=Operations&operation=Create-Paid-Account)
    * [Get-Account](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/api-details#api=Operations&operation=Get-Account)
    * [Get-Accounts-Authorization](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/api-details#api=Operations&operation=Get-Accounts-Authorization)
    * [Get-Accounts-With-Token](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/api-details#api=Operations&operation=Get-Accounts-With-Token)

    The Account object has a `Url` field pointing to the location of the [Azure Video Indexer website](https://www.videoindexer.ai/).
For paid accounts the `Url` field is currently pointing to an internal URL instead of the public website.
In the coming weeks we will change it and return the [Azure Video Indexer website](https://www.videoindexer.ai/) URL for all accounts (trial and paid).

    Do not use the internal URLs, you should be using the [Azure Video Indexer public APIs](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/).
* If you are embedding Azure Video Indexer URLs in your applications and the URLs are not pointing to the [Azure Video Indexer website](https://www.videoindexer.ai/) or the Azure Video Indexer API endpoint (`https://api.videoindexer.ai`) but rather to a regional endpoint (for example, `https://wus2.videoindexer.ai`), regenerate the URLs.

   You can do it by either:

    * Replacing the URL with a URL pointing to the Azure Video Indexer widget APIs (for example, the [insights widget](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/api-details#api=Operations&operation=Get-Video-Insights-Widget))
    * Using the Azure Video Indexer website to generate a new embedded URL:

         Press **Play** to get to your video's page -> click the **&lt;/&gt; Embed** button -> copy the URL into your application:

    The regional URLs are not supported and will be blocked in the coming weeks.

## January 2020

### Custom language support for additional languages

Azure Video Indexer now supports custom language models for `ar-SY` , `en-UK`, and `en-AU` (API only).

To fix the account configuration, in the Azure Video Indexer portal navigate to Settings > Account tab (as owner).

### Configure the custom vision account

Configure the custom vision account on paid accounts using the Azure Video Indexer portal (previously, this was only supported by API). To do that, sign in to the Azure Video Indexer portal, choose Model Customization > Animated characters > Configure.

### Scenes, shots and keyframes – now in one insight pane

Scenes, shots, and keyframes are now merged into one insight for easier consumption and navigation. When you select the desired scene you can see what shots and keyframes it consists of.

### Notification about a long video name

When a video name is longer than 80 characters, Azure Video Indexer shows a descriptive error on upload.

### Streaming endpoint is disabled notification

When streaming endpoint is disabled, Azure Video Indexer will show a descriptive error on the player page.

### Error handling improvement

Status code 409 will now be returned from [Re-Index Video](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/api-details#api=Operations&operation=Re-Index-Video) and [Update Video Index](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/api-details#api=Operations&operation=Update-Video-Index) APIs in case a video is actively indexed, to prevent overriding the current re-index changes by accident.

## November 2019

* Korean custom language models support

    Azure Video Indexer now supports custom language models in Korean (`ko-KR`) in both the API and portal.
* New languages supported for speech-to-text (STT)
