# Configure customer-managed keys in an Azure key vault for an existing storage account

Azure Storage encrypts all data in a storage account at rest. By default, data is encrypted with Microsoft-managed keys. For additional control over encryption keys, you can manage your own keys. Customer-managed keys must be stored in Azure Key Vault or Key Vault Managed Hardware Security Model (HSM).

This article shows how to configure encryption with customer-managed keys for an existing storage account. The customer-managed keys are stored in a key vault.

To learn how to configure customer-managed keys for a new storage account, see [Configure customer-managed keys in an Azure key vault for an existing storage account](customer-managed-keys-configure-existing-account.md).

To learn how to configure encryption with customer-managed keys stored in a managed HSM, see [Configure encryption with customer-managed keys stored in Azure Key Vault Managed HSM](customer-managed-keys-configure-key-vault-hsm.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Key Vault and Azure Key Vault Managed HSM support the same APIs and management interfaces for configuration.

[!INCLUDE [storage-customer-managed-keys-key-vault-add-key-include](../../../includes/storage-customer-managed-keys-key-vault-add-key-include.md)]

## Choose a managed identity to authorize access to the key vault

When you enable customer-managed keys for an existing storage account, you must specify a managed identity that will be used to authorize access to the key vault that contains the key. The managed identity must have permissions to access the key in the key vault.

The managed identity that authorizes access to the key vault may be either a user-assigned or system-assigned managed identity. To learn more about system-assigned versus user-assigned managed identities, see [Managed identity types](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md#managed-identity-types).

### Use a user-assigned managed identity to authorize access

A user-assigned is a standalone Azure resource. You must create the user-assigned identity before you configure customer-managed keys. To learn how to create and manage a user-assigned managed identity, see [Manage user-assigned managed identities](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-manage-user-assigned-managed-identities.md).

#### [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

When you configure customer-managed keys with the Azure portal, you can select an existing user-assigned identity through the portal user interface. For details, see [Configure customer-managed keys for an existing account](#configure-customer-managed-keys-for-an-existing-account).

#### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

To authorize access to the key vault with a user-assigned managed identity, you'll need the resource ID and principal ID of the user-assigned managed identity. Call [Get-AzUserAssignedIdentity](/powershell/module/az.managedserviceidentity/get-azuserassignedidentity) to get the user-assigned managed identity and assign it to a variable that you'll reference in subsequent steps:

```azurepowershell
$userIdentity = Get-AzUserAssignedIdentity -Name <user-assigned-identity> -ResourceGroupName <resource-group>
$principalId = $userIdentity.PrincipalId
```

#### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To authorize access to the key vault with a user-assigned managed identity, you'll need the resource ID and principal ID of the user-assigned managed identity. Call [az identity show](/cli/azure/identity#az-identity-show) command to get the user-assigned managed identity, then save the resource ID and principal ID to variables. You'll need these values in subsequent steps:

```azurecli
userIdentityId=$(az identity show --name sample-user-assigned-identity --resource-group storagesamples-rg --query id)
principalId=$(az identity show --name sample-user-assigned-identity --resource-group storagesamples-rg --query principalId)
```

---

### Use a system-assigned managed identity to authorize access

A system-assigned managed identity is associated with an instance of an Azure service, in this case an Azure Storage account. You must explicitly assign a system-assigned managed identity to a storage account before you can use the system-assigned managed identity to authorize access to the key vault that contains your customer-managed key.

Only existing storage accounts can use a system-assigned identity to authorize access to the key vault. New storage accounts must use a user-assigned identity, if customer-managed keys are configured on account creation.

#### [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

When you configure customer-managed keys with the Azure portal with a system-assigned managed identity, the system-assigned managed identity is assigned to the storage account for you under the covers. For details, see [Configure customer-managed keys for an existing account](#configure-customer-managed-keys-for-an-existing-account).

#### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

To assign a system-assigned managed identity to your storage account, call [Set-AzStorageAccount](/powershell/module/az.storage/set-azstorageaccount):

```azurepowershell
$storageAccount = Set-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName <resource_group> `
    -Name <storage-account> `
    -AssignIdentity
```

Next, get the principal ID for the system-assigned managed identity, and save it to a variable. You'll need this value in the next step to create the key vault access policy:

```azurepowershell
$principalId = $storageAccount.Identity.PrincipalId
```

#### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To authenticate access to the key vault with a system-assigned managed identity, assign the system-assigned managed identity to the storage account by calling [az storage account update](/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-update):

```azurecli
az storage account update \
    --name <storage-account> \
    --resource-group <resource_group> \
    --assign-identity
```

Next, get the principal ID for the system-assigned managed identity, and save it to a variable. You'll need this value in the next step to create the key vault access policy:

```azurecli
principalId = $(az storage account show --name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource_group> --query identity.principalId)
```

---

## Configure the key vault access policy

The next step is to configure the key vault access policy. The key vault access policy grants permissions to the managed identity that will be used to authorize access to the key vault. To learn more about key vault access policies, see [Azure Key Vault Overview](../../key-vault/general/overview.md#securely-store-secrets-and-keys) and [Azure Key Vault security overview](../../key-vault/general/security-features.md#key-vault-authentication-options).

### [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

To learn how to configure the key vault access policy with the Azure portal, see [Assign an Azure Key Vault access policy](../../key-vault/general/assign-access-policy.md).

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

To configure the key vault access policy with PowerShell, call [Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy](/powershell/module/az.keyvault/set-azkeyvaultaccesspolicy), providing the variable for the principal ID that you previously retrieved for the managed identity.

```azurepowershell
Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy `
    -VaultName $keyVault.VaultName `
    -ObjectId $principalId `
    -PermissionsToKeys wrapkey,unwrapkey,get
```

To learn more about assigning the key vault access policy with PowerShell, see [Assign an Azure Key Vault access policy](../../key-vault/general/assign-access-policy.md).

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To configure the key vault access policy with PowerShell, call [az keyvault set-policy](/cli/azure/keyvault#az-keyvault-set-policy), providing the variable for the principal ID that you previously retrieved for the managed identity.

```azurecli
az keyvault set-policy \
    --name <key-vault> \
    --resource-group <resource_group>
    --object-id $principalId \
    --key-permissions get unwrapKey wrapKey
```

To learn more about assigning the key vault access policy with Azure CLI, see [Assign an Azure Key Vault access policy](../../key-vault/general/assign-access-policy.md).

## Configure customer-managed keys for an existing account

When you configure encryption with customer-managed keys for an existing storage account, you can choose to automatically update the key version used for Azure Storage encryption whenever a new version is available in the associated key vault. Alternately, you can explicitly specify a key version to be used for encryption until the key version is manually updated.

You can use either a system-assigned or user-assigned managed identity to authorize access to the key vault when you configure customer-managed keys for an existing storage account.

> [!NOTE]
> To rotate a key, create a new version of the key in Azure Key Vault. Azure Storage does not handle key rotation, so you will need to manage rotation of the key in the key vault. You can [configure key auto-rotation in Azure Key Vault](../../key-vault/keys/how-to-configure-key-rotation.md) or rotate your key manually.

### Configure encryption for automatic updating of key versions

Azure Storage can automatically update the customer-managed key that is used for encryption to use the latest key version from the key vault. Azure Storage checks the key vault daily for a new version of the key. When a new version becomes available, then Azure Storage automatically begins using the latest version of the key for encryption.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Storage checks the key vault for a new key version only once daily. When you rotate a key, be sure to wait 24 hours before disabling the older version.

### [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

To configure customer-managed keys for an existing account with automatic updating of the key version in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your storage account.
1. On the **Settings** blade for the storage account, select **Encryption**. By default, key management is set to **Microsoft Managed Keys**, as shown in the following image.

    :::image type="content" source="media/customer-managed-keys-configure-existing-account/portal-configure-encryption-keys.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing encryption options in Azure portal." lightbox="media/customer-managed-keys-configure-existing-account/portal-configure-encryption-keys.png":::

1. Select the **Customer Managed Keys** option.
1. Choose the **Select from Key Vault** option.
1. Select **Select a key vault and key**.
1. Select the key vault containing the key you want to use. You can also create a new key vault.
1. Select the key from the key vault. You can also create a new key.

    :::image type="content" source="media/customer-managed-keys-configure-existing-account/portal-select-key-from-key-vault.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to select key vault and key in Azure portal.":::

1. Select the type of identity to use to authenticate access to the key vault. The options include **System-assigned** (the default) or **User-assigned**. To learn more about each type of managed identity, see [Managed identity types](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md#managed-identity-types).

    1. If you select **System-assigned**, the system-assigned managed identity for the storage account is created under the covers, if it doesn't already exist.
    1. If you select **User-assigned**, then you must select an existing user-assigned identity that has permissions to access the key vault. To learn how to create a user-assigned identity, see [Manage user-assigned managed identities](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-manage-user-assigned-managed-identities.md).

    :::image type="content" source="media/customer-managed-keys-configure-existing-account/select-user-assigned-managed-identity-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to select a user-assigned managed identity for key vault authentication.":::

1. Save your changes.

After you've specified the key, the Azure portal indicates that automatic updating of the key version is enabled and displays the key version currently in use for encryption. The portal also displays the type of managed identity used to authorize access to the key vault and the principal ID for the managed identity.

:::image type="content" source="media/customer-managed-keys-configure-existing-account/portal-auto-rotation-enabled.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing automatic updating of the key version enabled.":::

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

To configure customer-managed keys for an existing account with automatic updating of the key version with PowerShell, install the [Az.Storage](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az.Storage) module, version 2.0.0 or later.

Next, call [Set-AzStorageAccount](/powershell/module/az.storage/set-azstorageaccount) to update the storage account's encryption settings, omitting the key version. Include the **-KeyvaultEncryption** option to enable customer-managed keys for the storage account.

```azurepowershell
Set-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> `
    -AccountName <storage-account> `
    -KeyvaultEncryption `
    -KeyName $key.Name `
    -KeyVaultUri $keyVault.VaultUri
```

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To configure customer-managed keys for an existing account with automatic updating of the key version with Azure CLI, install [Azure CLI version 2.4.0](/cli/azure/release-notes-azure-cli#april-21-2020) or later. For more information, see [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Next, call [az storage account update](/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-update) to update the storage account's encryption settings, omitting the key version. Include the `--encryption-key-source` parameter and set it to `Microsoft.Keyvault` to enable customer-managed keys for the account.

```azurecli
key_vault_uri=$(az keyvault show \
    --name <key-vault> \
    --resource-group <resource_group> \
    --query properties.vaultUri \
    --output tsv)
az storage account update
    --name <storage-account> \
    --resource-group <resource_group> \
    --encryption-key-name <key> \
    --encryption-key-source Microsoft.Keyvault \
    --encryption-key-vault $key_vault_uri
```

---

### Configure encryption for manual updating of key versions

If you prefer to manually update the key version, then explicitly specify the version at the time that you configure encryption with customer-managed keys. In this case, Azure Storage won't automatically update the key version when a new version is created in the key vault. To use a new key version, you must manually update the version used for Azure Storage encryption.

# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

To configure customer-managed keys with manual updating of the key version in the Azure portal, specify the key URI, including the version. To specify a key as a URI, follow these steps:

1. To locate the key URI in the Azure portal, navigate to your key vault, and select the **Keys** setting. Select the desired key, then select the key to view its versions. Select a key version to view the settings for that version.
1. Copy the value of the **Key Identifier** field, which provides the URI.

    :::image type="content" source="media/customer-managed-keys-configure-existing-account/portal-copy-key-identifier.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing key vault key URI in Azure portal.":::

1. In the **Encryption key** settings for your storage account, choose the **Enter key URI** option.
1. Paste the URI that you copied into the **Key URI** field. Omit the key version from the URI to enable automatic updating of the key version.

    :::image type="content" source="media/customer-managed-keys-configure-existing-account/portal-specify-key-uri.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to enter key URI in Azure portal.":::

1. Specify the subscription that contains the key vault.
1. Specify either a system-assigned or user-assigned managed identity.
1. Save your changes.

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

To configure customer-managed keys with manual updating of the key version, explicitly provide the key version when you configure encryption for the storage account. Call [Set-AzStorageAccount](/powershell/module/az.storage/set-azstorageaccount) to update the storage account's encryption settings, as shown in the following example, and include the **-KeyvaultEncryption** option to enable customer-managed keys for the storage account.

Remember to replace the placeholder values in brackets with your own values and to use the variables defined in the previous examples.

```azurepowershell
Set-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> `
    -AccountName <storage-account> `
    -KeyvaultEncryption `
    -KeyName $key.Name `
    -KeyVersion $key.Version `
    -KeyVaultUri $keyVault.VaultUri
```

When you manually update the key version, you'll need to update the storage account's encryption settings to use the new version. First, call [Get-AzKeyVaultKey](/powershell/module/az.keyvault/get-azkeyvaultkey) to get the latest version of the key. Then call [Set-AzStorageAccount](/powershell/module/az.storage/set-azstorageaccount) to update the storage account's encryption settings to use the new version of the key, as shown in the previous example.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To configure customer-managed keys with manual updating of the key version, explicitly provide the key version when you configure encryption for the storage account. Call [az storage account update](/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-update) to update the storage account's encryption settings, as shown in the following example. Include the `--encryption-key-source` parameter and set it to `Microsoft.Keyvault` to enable customer-managed keys for the account.

Remember to replace the placeholder values in brackets with your own values.

```azurecli
key_vault_uri=$(az keyvault show \
    --name <key-vault> \
    --resource-group <resource_group> \
    --query properties.vaultUri \
    --output tsv)
key_version=$(az keyvault key list-versions \
    --name <key> \
    --vault-name <key-vault> \
    --query [-1].kid \
    --output tsv | cut -d '/' -f 6)
az storage account update
    --name <storage-account> \
    --resource-group <resource_group> \
    --encryption-key-name <key> \
    --encryption-key-version $key_version \
    --encryption-key-source Microsoft.Keyvault \
    --encryption-key-vault $key_vault_uri
```

When you manually update the key version, you'll need to update the storage account's encryption settings to use the new version. First, query for the key vault URI by calling [az keyvault show](/cli/azure/keyvault#az-keyvault-show), and for the key version by calling [az keyvault key list-versions](/cli/azure/keyvault/key#az-keyvault-key-list-versions). Then call [az storage account update](/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-update) to update the storage account's encryption settings to use the new version of the key, as shown in the previous example.
