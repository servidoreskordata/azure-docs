# What's new in Microsoft Defender for IoT?

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](../includes/banner.md)]

This article lists Microsoft Defender for IoT's new features and enhancements for end-user organizations from the last nine months.

Features released earlier than nine months ago are listed in [What's new archive for Microsoft Defender for IoT for organizations](release-notes-archive.md).

Noted features listed below are in PREVIEW. The [Azure Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include other legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## Versioning and support for on-premises software versions

The Defender for IoT architecture uses on-premises sensors and management servers. This section describes the servicing information and timelines for the available on-premises software versions.

- **Starting in version 22.1.x**, each General Availability (GA) version of the Defender for IoT sensor and on-premises management console software is supported for nine months after its first minor release date, not including hotfix releases.

    Release versions have the following syntax: **[Major][Minor][Hotfix]**

    Therefore, for example, all **22.1.x** versions, including all hotfix versions, are supported for nine months after the first **22.1.x** release.

    Fixes and new functionality are applied to each new version and are not applied to older versions.

- **Software update packages include new functionality and security patches**. Urgent, high-risk security updates are applied in minor versions that may be released throughout the quarter. 

- **Features available from the Azure portal that are dependent on a specific sensor version** are only available for sensors that have the required version installed, or higher.

For more information, see the [Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle practices](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/sdl/), which describes Microsoft's SDK practices, including training, compliance, threat modeling, design requirements, tools such as Microsoft Component Governance, pen testing, and more.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Manual changes to software packages may have detrimental effects on the sensor and on-premises management console. Microsoft is unable to support deployments with manual changes made to packages.
>

> [!TIP]
> - Version numbers are listed only in this article, and not in detailed descriptions elsewhere in the documentation. To understand whether a feature is supported in your sensor version, check the listed features for that sensor version on this page.
>
> - When updating your sensor software version, make sure to also update your on-premises management console. For more information, see [Update Defender for IoT OT monitoring software](update-ot-software.md).

**Current versions of the sensor and on-premises management console software include**:

| Version | Date released | End support date |

## August 2022

- **Sensor software version 22.2.5**: Minor version with stability improvements
- [New alert columns with timestamp data](#new-alert-columns-with-timestamp-data)
- [Sensor health from the Azure portal (Public preview)](#sensor-health-from-the-azure-portal-public-preview)

### New alert columns with timestamp data

Starting with OT sensor version 22.2.4, Defender for IoT alerts in the Azure portal and the sensor console now show the following columns and data:

- **Last detection**. Defines the last time the alert was detected in the network, and replaces the **Detection time** column.

- **First detection**. Defines the first time the alert was detected in the network.

- **Last activity**. Defines the last time the alert was changed, including manual updates for severity or status, or automated changes for device updates or device/alert de-duplication.

The **First detection** and **Last activity** columns aren't displayed by default. Add them to your **Alerts** page as needed.

> [!TIP]
> If you're also a Microsoft Sentinel user, you'll be familiar with similar data from your Log Analytics queries. The new alert columns in Defender for IoT are mapped as follows:
>
> - The Defender for IoT **Last detection** time is similar to the Log Analytics **EndTime**
> - The Defender for IoT **First detection** time is similar to the Log Analytics **StartTime**
> - The Defender for IoT **Last activity** time is similar to the Log Analytics **TimeGenerated**
For more information, see:

- [View alerts on the Defender for IoT portal](how-to-manage-cloud-alerts.md)
- [View alerts on your sensor](how-to-view-alerts.md)
- [OT threat monitoring in enterprise SOCs](concept-sentinel-integration.md)

### Sensor health from the Azure portal (Public preview)

For OT sensor versions 22.1.3 and higher, you can use the new sensor health widgets and table column data to monitor sensor health directly from the **Sites and sensors** page on the Azure portal.

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/sensor-health.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the new sensor health widgets." lightbox="media/release-notes/sensor-health.png":::

We've also added a sensor details page, where you drill down to a specific sensor from the Azure portal. On the **Sites and sensors** page, select a specific sensor name. The sensor details page lists basic sensor data, sensor health, and any sensor settings applied.

For more information, see [Understand sensor health (Public preview)](how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud.md#understand-sensor-health-public-preview) and [Sensor health message reference](sensor-health-messages.md).

### Enterprise IoT and Defender for Endpoint integration in GA

The Enterprise IoT integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is now in General Availability (GA). With this update, we've made the following updates and improvements:

- Onboard an Enterprise IoT plan directly in Defender for Endpoint. For more information, see [Manage your subscriptions](how-to-manage-subscriptions.md) and the [Defender for Endpoint documentation](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/enable-microsoft-defender-for-iot-integration).

- Seamless integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to view detected Enterprise IoT devices, and their related alerts, vulnerabilities, and recommendations in the Microsoft 365 Security portal. For more information, see the [Enterprise IoT tutorial](tutorial-getting-started-eiot-sensor.md) and the [Defender for Endpoint documentation](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/enable-microsoft-defender-for-iot-integration). You can continue to view detected Enterprise IoT devices on the Defender for IoT **Device inventory** page in the Azure portal.

- All Enterprise IoT sensors are now automatically added to the same site in Defender for IoT, named **Enterprise network**. When onboarding a new Enterprise IoT device, you only need to define a sensor name and select your subscription, without defining a site or zone.

> [!NOTE]
> The Enterprise IoT network sensor and all detections remain in Public Preview.

### Same passwords for cyberx_host and cyberx users

During OT monitoring software installations and updates, the **cyberx** user is assigned a random password. When updating from version 10.x.x to version 22.1.7, the **cyberx_host** password is assigned with an identical password to the **cyberx** user.

For more information, see [Update Defender for IoT OT monitoring software](update-ot-software.md).

### Device inventory enhancements

Starting in OT sensor versions 22.2.4, you can now take the following actions from the sensor console's **Device inventory** page:

- **Merge duplicate devices**. You may need to merge devices if the sensor has discovered separate network entities that are associated with a single, unique device. Examples of this scenario might include a PLC with four network cards, a laptop with both WiFi and a physical network card, or a single workstation with multiple network cards.

- **Delete single devices**. Now, you can delete a single device that hasn't communicated for at least 10 minutes.

- **Delete inactive devices by admin users**. Now, all admin users, in addition to the **cyberx** user, can delete inactive devices.

Also starting in version 22.2.4, in the sensor console's **Device inventory** page, the **Last seen** value in the device details pane is replaced by **Last activity**. For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/last-activity-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the new Last activity field showing in the sensor console's device details pane on the Device inventory page.":::

For more information, see [Manage your OT device inventory from a sensor console](how-to-investigate-sensor-detections-in-a-device-inventory.md).

### Enhancements for the ServiceNow integration API

OT sensor version 22.2.4 provides enhancements for the `devicecves` API, which gets details about the CVEs found for a given device.

Now you can add any of the following parameters to your query to fine tune your results:

- “**sensorId**” - Shows results from a specific sensor, as defined by the given sensor ID.
- “**score**” - Determines a minimum CVE score to be retrieved. All results will have a CVE score equal to or higher than the given value. Default = **0**.
- “**deviceIds**” -  A comma-separated list of device IDs from which you want to show results. For example: **1232,34,2,456**

For more information, see [Management console APIs - Version 3](references-work-with-defender-for-iot-apis.md#version-3).

### OT appliance hardware profile updates

We've refreshed the naming conventions for our OT appliance hardware profiles for greater transparency and clarity.

The new names reflect both the *type* of profile, including *Corporate*, *Enterprise*, and *Production line*, and also the related disk storage size.

Use the following table to understand the mapping between legacy hardware profile names and the current names used in the updated software installation:

|Legacy name  |New name  | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Corporate**     |    **C5600** | A *Corporate* environment, with: <br>16 Cores<br>32 GB RAM<br>5.6 TB disk storage |
|**Enterprise**     | **E1800** | An *Enterprise* environment, with: <br>8 Cores<br>32 GB RAM<br>1.8 TB disk storage        |
|**SMB**    |    **L500**   | A *Production line* environment, with: <br>4 Cores<br>8 GB RAM<br>500 GB disk storage  |
|**Office**     | **L100**  | A *Production line* environment, with: <br>4 Cores<br>8 GB RAM<br>100 GB disk storage      |
|**Rugged**     |   **L64** | A *Production line* environment, with: <br>4 Cores<br>8 GB RAM<br>64 GB disk storage     |

We also now support new enterprise hardware profiles, for sensors supporting both 500 GB and 1 TB disk sizes.

For more information, see [Which appliances do I need?](ot-appliance-sizing.md)

### PCAP access from the Azure portal (Public preview)

Now you can access the raw traffic files, known as packet capture files or PCAP files, directly from the Azure portal. This feature supports SOC or OT security engineers who want to investigate alerts from Defender for IoT or Microsoft Sentinel, without having to access each sensor separately.

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/pcap-request.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Download PCAP button." lightbox="media/release-notes/pcap-request.png":::

PCAP files are downloaded to your Azure storage.

For more information, see [View and manage alerts from the Azure portal](how-to-manage-cloud-alerts.md).

### Bi-directional alert synch between sensors and the Azure portal (Public preview)

For sensors updated to version 22.2.1, alert statuses and learn statuses are now fully synchronized between the sensor console and the Azure portal. For example, this means that you can close an alert on the Azure portal or the sensor console, and the alert status is updated in both locations.

*Learn* an alert from either the Azure portal or the sensor console to ensure that it's not triggered again the next time the same network traffic is detected.

The sensor console is also synchronized with an on-premises management console, so that alert statuses and learn statuses remain up-to-date across your management interfaces.

For more information, see:

- [View and manage alerts from the Azure portal](how-to-manage-cloud-alerts.md)
- [View alerts on your sensor](how-to-view-alerts.md)
- [Manage alerts from the sensor console](how-to-manage-the-alert-event.md)
- [Work with alerts on the on-premises management console](how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console.md)

### Sensor connections restored after certificate rotation

Starting in version 22.2.3, after rotating your certificates, your sensor connections are automatically restored to your central manager, and you don't need to reconnect them manually.

For more information, see [About certificates](how-to-deploy-certificates.md).

### Support diagnostic log enhancements (Public preview)

Starting in sensor version [22.1.1](#new-support-diagnostics-log), you've been able to download a diagnostic log from the sensor console to send to support when you open a ticket.

Now, for locally managed sensors, you can upload that diagnostic log directly on the Azure portal.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/upload-diagnostics-log.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Send diagnostic files to support option." lightbox="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/upload-diagnostics-log.png":::

> [!TIP]
> For cloud-connected sensors, starting from sensor version [22.1.3](#march-2022), the diagnostic log is automatically available to support when you open the ticket.

For more information, see [Manage proprietary protocols with Horizon plugins](resources-manage-proprietary-protocols.md).

### Sensor names shown in browser tabs

Starting in sensor version 22.2.3, your sensor's name is displayed in the browser tab, making it easier for you to identify the sensors you're working with.

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/sensor-name-in-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sensor name shown in the browser tab.":::

### Microsoft Sentinel incident synch with Defender for IoT alerts

The **IoT OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT** solution now ensures that alerts in Defender for IoT are updated with any related incident **Status** changes from Microsoft Sentinel.

This synchronization overrides any status defined in Defender for IoT, in the Azure portal or the sensor console, so that the alert statuses match that of the related incident.

Update your **IoT OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT** solution to use the latest synchronization support, including the new **AD4IoT-AutoAlertStatusSync** playbook. After updating the solution, make sure that you also take the [required steps](../../sentinel/iot-solution.md?tabs=use-out-of-the-box-analytics-rules-recommended#update-alert-statuses-in-defender-for-iot) to ensure that the new playbook works as expected.

For more information, see [Defender for IoT installation](how-to-install-software.md).

### Sensor redesign and unified Microsoft product experience

The Defender for IoT sensor console has been redesigned to create a unified Microsoft Azure experience and enhance and simplify workflows.

These features are now Generally Available (GA). Updates include the general look and feel, drill-down panes, search and action options, and more. For example:

**Simplified workflows include**:

- The **Device inventory** page now includes detailed device pages. Select a device in the table and then select **View full details** on the right.

    :::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/device-inventory-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the View full details button." lightbox="media/release-notes/device-inventory-details.png":::

- Properties updated from the sensor's inventory are now automatically updated in the cloud device inventory.

- The device details pages, accessed either from the **Device map** or **Device inventory** pages, is shown as read only. To modify device properties, select **Edit properties** on the bottom-left.

- The **Data mining** page now includes reporting functionality. While the **Reports** page was removed, users with read-only access can view updates on the **Data mining page** without the ability to modify reports or settings.

    For admin users creating new reports, you can now toggle on a **Send to CM** option to send the report to a central management console as well. For more information, see [Create a report](how-to-create-data-mining-queries.md#create-a-report).

- The **System settings** area has been reorganized in to sections for *Basic* settings, settings for *Network monitoring*, *Sensor management*, *Integrations*, and *Import settings*.

- The sensor online help now links to key articles in the Microsoft Defender for IoT documentation.

**Defender for IoT maps now include**:

- A new **Map View** is now shown for alerts and on the device details pages, showing where in your environment the alert or device is found.

- Right-click a device on the map to view contextual information about the device, including related alerts, event timeline data, and connected devices.

- To enable the ability to collapse IT networks, ensure that the **Toggle IT Networks Grouping** option is enabled. This option is now only available from the map.

- The **Simplified Map View** option has been removed.

We've also implemented global readiness and accessibility features to comply with Microsoft standards. In the on-premises sensor console, these updates include both high contrast and regular screen display themes and localization for over 15 languages. 

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/dark-mode.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sensor console in dark mode." lightbox="media/release-notes/dark-mode.png":::

Access global readiness and accessibility options from the **Settings** icon at the top-right corner of your screen:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/settings-icon.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows localization options." lightbox="media/release-notes/settings-icon.png":::

### Enhanced sensor Overview page

The Defender for IoT sensor portal's **Dashboard** page has been renamed as **Overview**, and now includes data that better highlights system deployment details, critical network monitoring health, top alerts, and important trends and statistics.

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/new-interface.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the updated interface." lightbox="media/release-notes/new-interface.png":::

The Overview page also now serves as a *black box* to view your overall sensor status in case your outbound connections, such as to the Azure portal, go down.

Create more dashboards using the **Trends & Statistics** page, located under the **Analyze** menu on the left.

### New support diagnostics log

Now you can get a summary of the log and system information that gets added to your support tickets. In the **Backup and Restore** dialog, select **Support Ticket Diagnostics**.

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/support-ticket-diagnostics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Backup and Restore dialog showing the Support Ticket Diagnostics option." lightbox="media/release-notes/support-ticket-diagnostics.png":::

Alerts are now available in Defender for IoT in the Azure portal. Work with alerts to enhance the security and operation of your IoT/OT network.

The new **Alerts** page is currently in Public Preview, and provides: 

- An aggregated, real-time view of threats detected by network sensors.
- Remediation steps for devices and network processes.
- Streaming alerts to Microsoft Sentinel and empower your SOC team.
- Alert storage for 90 days from the time they're first detected.
- Tools to investigate source and destination activity, alert severity and status, MITRE ATT&CK information, and contextual information about the alert.

For example:

**On the sensor console**:

On the sensor console, the **Alerts** page now shows details for alerts detected by sensors that are configured with a cloud-connection to Defender for IoT on Azure. Users working with alerts in both Azure and on-premises should understand how alerts are managed between the Azure portal and the on-premises components.

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/alerts-in-console.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the new Alerts page on the sensor console." lightbox="media/release-notes/alerts-in-console.png":::

Other alert updates include:

- **Access contextual data** for each alert, such as events that occurred around the same time, or a map of connected devices. Maps of connected devices are available for sensor console alerts only.

- **Alert statuses** are updated, and, for example,  now include a *Closed* status instead of *Acknowledged*.

- **Alert storage** for 90 days from the time that they're first detected.

- The **Backup Activity with Antivirus Signatures Alert**. This new alert warning is triggered for traffic detected between a source device and destination backup server, which is often legitimate backup activity. Critical or major malware alerts are no longer triggered for such activity.

- **During upgrades**, sensor console alerts that are currently archived are deleted. Pinned alerts are no longer supported, so pins are removed for sensor console alerts as relevant.

### Custom alert updates

The sensor console's **Custom alert rules** page now provides:

- Hit count information in the **Custom alert rules** table, with at-a-glance details about the number of alerts triggered in the last week for each rule you've created.

- The ability to schedule custom alert rules to run outside of regular working hours.

- The ability to alert on any field that can be extracted from a protocol using the DPI engine.

- Complete protocol support when creating custom rules, and support for an extensive range of related protocol variables.

For more information and the updated custom alert procedure, see [Customize alert rules](how-to-accelerate-alert-incident-response.md#customize-alert-rules).

### CLI command updates

The Defender for Iot sensor software installation is now containerized. With the now-containerized sensor, you can use the *cyberx_host* user to investigate issues with other containers or the operating system, or to send files via FTP.

This *cyberx_host* user is available by default and connects to the host machine. If you need to, recover the password for the *cyberx_host* user from the **Sites and sensors** page in Defender for IoT.

As part of the containerized sensor, the following CLI commands have been modified:

|Legacy name  |Replacement  |
|---------|---------|
|`cyberx-xsense-reconfigure-interfaces`    |`sudo dpkg-reconfigure iot-sensor`         |
|`cyberx-xsense-reload-interfaces`     |  `sudo dpkg-reconfigure iot-sensor`      |
|`cyberx-xsense-reconfigure-hostname`     | `sudo dpkg-reconfigure iot-sensor`       |
| `cyberx-xsense-system-remount-disks` |`sudo dpkg-reconfigure iot-sensor` |

The `sudo cyberx-xsense-limit-interface-I eth0 -l value` CLI command was removed. This command was used to limit the interface bandwidth that the sensor uses for day-to-day procedures, and is no longer supported.

For more information, see [Defender for IoT installation](how-to-install-software.md) and [Work with Defender for IoT CLI commands](references-work-with-defender-for-iot-cli-commands.md).

### Update to version 22.1.x

To use all of Defender for IoT's latest features, make sure to update your sensor software versions to 22.1.x.

If you're on a legacy version, you may need to run a series of updates in order to get to the latest version. You'll also need to update your firewall rules and re-activate your sensor with a new activation file.

After you've upgraded to version 22.1.x, the new upgrade log can be found at the following path, accessed via SSH and the *cyberx_host* user: `/opt/sensor/logs/legacy-upgrade.log`.

For more information, see [Update OT system software](update-ot-software.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Upgrading to version 22.1.x is a large update, and you should expect the update process to require more time than previous updates.
>

### New connectivity model and firewall requirements

Defender for IoT version 22.1.x supports a new set of sensor connection methods that provide simplified deployment, improved security, scalability, and flexible connectivity.

In addition to [migration steps](connect-sensors.md#migration-for-existing-customers), this new connectivity model requires that you open a new firewall rule. For more information, see:

- **New firewall requirements**: [Sensor access to Azure portal](how-to-set-up-your-network.md#sensor-access-to-azure-portal).
- **Architecture**: [Sensor connection methods](architecture-connections.md)
- **Connection procedures**: [Connect your sensors to Microsoft Defender for IoT](connect-sensors.md)

### Protocol improvements

This version of Defender for IoT provides improved support for:

- Profinet DCP
- Honeywell
- Windows endpoint detection

### Modified, replaced, or removed options and configurations

The following Defender for IoT options and configurations have been moved, removed, and/or replaced:

- Reports previously found on the **Reports** page are now shown on the **Data Mining** page instead. You can also continue to view data mining information directly from the on-premises management console.

- Changing a locally managed sensor name is now supported only by onboarding the sensor to the Azure portal again with the new name. Sensor names can no longer be changed directly from the sensor. For more information, see [Change the name of a sensor](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#change-the-name-of-a-sensor).


## December 2021

**Sensor software version**: 10.5.4

- [Enhanced integration with Microsoft Sentinel (Preview)](#enhanced-integration-with-microsoft-sentinel-preview)
- [Apache Log4j vulnerability](#apache-log4j-vulnerability)
- [Alerting](#alerting)

### Enhanced integration with Microsoft Sentinel (Preview)

The new **IoT OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT solution** is available and provides enhanced capabilities for Microsoft Defender for IoT integration with Microsoft Sentinel. The **IoT OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT solution** is a set of bundled content, including analytics rules, workbooks, and playbooks, configured specifically for Defender for IoT data. This solution currently supports only Operational Networks (OT/ICS). 

For information on integrating with Microsoft Sentinel, see [Tutorial: Integrate Defender for Iot and Sentinel](../../sentinel/iot-solution.md?tabs=use-out-of-the-box-analytics-rules-recommended)

### Apache Log4j vulnerability

Version 10.5.4 of Microsoft Defender for IoT mitigates the Apache Log4j vulnerability. For details, see [the security advisory update](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-iot/updated-15-dec-defender-for-iot-security-advisory-apache-log4j/m-p/3036844).

### Alerting

Version 10.5.4 of Microsoft Defender for IoT delivers important alert enhancements:

- Alerts for certain minor events or edge-cases are now disabled.
- For certain scenarios, similar alerts are minimized in a single alert message.

These changes reduce alert volume and enable more efficient targeting and analysis of security and operational events.

#### Alerts permanently disabled

The alerts listed below are permanently disabled with version 10.5.4. Detection and monitoring are still supported for traffic associated with the alerts.

**Policy engine alerts**

- RPC Procedure Invocations
- Unauthorized HTTP Server
- Abnormal usage of MAC Addresses

#### Alerts disabled by default

The alerts listed below are disabled by default with version 10.5.4. You can re-enable the alerts from the Support page of the sensor console, if necessary.

**Anomaly engine alert**
- Abnormal Number of Parameters in HTTP Header
- Abnormal HTTP Header Length
- Illegal HTTP Header Content

**Operational engine alerts**
- HTTP Client Error
- RPC Operation Failed

**Policy engine alerts**

Disabling these alerts also disables monitoring of related traffic. Specifically, this traffic won't be reported in Data Mining reports.

- Illegal HTTP Communication alert and HTTP Connections Data Mining traffic
- Unauthorized HTTP User Agent alert and HTTP User Agents Data Mining traffic
- Unauthorized HTTP SOAP Action and HTTP SOAP Actions Data Mining traffic

#### Updated alert functionality

**Unauthorized Database Operation alert**
Previously, this alert covered DDL and DML alerting and Data Mining reporting. Now:
- DDL traffic: alerting and monitoring are supported.
- DML traffic: Monitoring is supported.  Alerting isn't supported.

**New Asset Detected alert**
This alert is disabled for new devices detected in IT subnets. The New Asset Detected alert is still triggered for new devices discovered in OT subnets. OT subnets are detected automatically and can be updated by users if necessary.

### Minimized alerting

Alert triggering for specific scenarios has been minimized to help reduce alert volume and simplify alert investigation. In these scenarios, if a device performs repeated activity on targets, an alert is triggered once.  Previously, a new alert was triggered each time the same activity was carried out.

This new functionality is available on the following alerts:

- Port Scan Detected alerts, based on activity of the source device (generated by the Anomaly engine)
- Malware alerts, based on activity of the source device. (generated by the Malware engine). 
- Suspicion of Denial of Service Attack alerts, based on activity of the destination device (generated by the Malware engine)
