### Public Preview - External user leave settings

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Enterprise Apps  
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C 

Currently, users can self-service leave for an organization without the visibility of their IT administrators. Some organizations may want more control over this self-service process.

By removing the secrets required to access Azure AD protected resources, workload identity federation can improve the security posture of your organization. This feature also reduces the burden of secret management and minimizes the risk of service downtime due to expired credentials. 

For more information on this capability and supported scenarios, see [Workload identity federation](../develop/workload-identity-federation.md).

###  General Availability – Protect against by-passing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** MS Graph  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection  
 

We're delighted to announce a new security protection that prevents bypassing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD. When enabled for a federated domain in your Azure AD tenant, it ensures that a compromised federated account can't bypass Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication by imitating that a multi factor authentication has already been performed by the identity provider. The protection can be enabled via new security setting, [federatedIdpMfaBehavior](/graph/api/resources/internaldomainfederation?view=graph-rest-beta#federatedidpmfabehavior-values).

 
We highly recommend enabling this new protection when using Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication as your multi factor authentication for your federated users. To learn more about the protection and how to enable it, visit [Enable protection to prevent by-passing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/best-practices-securing-ad-fs#enable-protection-to-prevent-by-passing-of-cloud-azure-ad-multi-factor-authentication-when-federated-with-azure-ad).

###  Public Preview – Protect against by-passing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** MS Graph  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection  


We're delighted to announce a new security protection that prevents bypassing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD. When enabled for a federated domain in your Azure AD tenant, it ensures that a compromised federated account can't bypass Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication by imitating that a multi factor authentication has already been performed by the identity provider. The protection can be enabled via new security setting, [federatedIdpMfaBehavior](/graph/api/resources/internaldomainfederation?view=graph-rest-beta#federatedidpmfabehavior-values&preserve-view=true). 

We highly recommend enabling this new protection when using Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication as your multi factor authentication for your federated users. To learn more about the protection and how to enable it, visit [Enable protection to prevent by-passing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/best-practices-securing-ad-fs#enable-protection-to-prevent-by-passing-of-cloud-azure-ad-multi-factor-authentication-when-federated-with-azure-ad).
