# Run a workflow on-demand (Preview)

While most workflows by default are scheduled to run every 3 hours, workflows created using Lifecycle Workflows can also run on-demand so that they can be applied to specific users whenever you see fit. A workflow can be run on demand for any user and doesn't take into account whether or not a user meets the workflow's execution conditions. Workflows created in the Azure portal are disabled by default. Running a workflow on-demand allows you to run workflows that can't be run on schedule currently such as leaver workflows. It also allows you to test workflows before their scheduled run. You can test the workflow on a smaller group of users before enabling it for a broader audience.

>[!NOTE]
>Be aware that you currently cannot run a workflow on-demand if it is set to disabled, which is the default state of newly created workflows using the Azure portal.  You need to set the workflow to enabled to use the on-demand feature.

## Run a workflow on-demand using Microsoft Graph

Running a workflow on-demand using Microsoft Graph requires users to manually be added by their user ID with a POST call.

To run a workflow on-demand in Microsoft Graph, use the following request and body:
```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identityGovernance/lifecycleWorkflows/workflows/<id>/activate
Content-type: application/json
```

```Request body
{
   "subjects":[
      {"id":"<userid>"},
      {"id":"<userid>"}
   ]
}

```
